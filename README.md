# PythonAutoAttendance (Rhul Auto Attendance)

Lectures are pointless, but they annoy me if my attendance is low, so this bot goes brrr and looks like im a very good student.

## How to run this?

1. Create an environment with the following:

    ```
    EMAIL="UNI_EMAIL"
    PASS="UNI_PASS"
    PRIVKEY="YOUR_TOKEN_KEY"
    ```

2. Install Poetry, the package manager for python
3. Install the required libraries: Selenium and pyotp
4. Make sure that Firefox is installed in your system

5. Once the environment variables are set, run the script using the command "poetry run python src/PythonAuto.py"

6. Troubleshoot: If you have any issues running the script, please make sure that you have the latest version of Firefox and Selenium installed on your machine.

7. Note: Dont bother with lectures.
